    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Marcin and I'm a creator of Farmer Olaf. 
        Why I made this game? I travel a lot and people (including me) 
        with families don't have much choice when it comes to entertainment 
        during travel. I wanted to give families a choice other than using 
        mobile phones and tablets. Thus I've designed no.table and mini 
        table boxes that allow Farmer Olaf to be played without a table. 
        Gameplay wise it's good for almost all ages when playing with 
        adult(s). The game has many educational values as well (read below). 
        It encourages cooperation, being pro-active and social while 
        teaching how to negotiate and being assertive. If you have more
         questions and want to contact me see the bottom of the page.</p>
