        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Marcin and I'm a creator of Farmer Olaf.
            Why I made this game? I travel a lot and people (including me)
            with families don't have much choice when it comes to entertainment
            during travel. I wanted to give families a choice other than using
            mobile phones and tablets. Thus I've designed no.table and mini
            table boxes that allow Farmer Olaf to be played without a table.
            Gameplay wise it's good for almost all ages when playing with
            adult(s). <br>The game has many educational values as well (read below).
            It encourages cooperation, being pro-active and social while
            teaching how to negotiate and being assertive. If you have more
            questions and want to contact me see the bottom of the page.</p>
