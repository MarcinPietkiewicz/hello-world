    <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How to deal with being stuck</li>

        <p>Sometimes you can't produce anything even though you have lots of workers and forage. You usually lack either
            an animal, manure or an infrastructure card.
            How to proceed forward? You can always ask other players to sell you a card you need.
            If this is not possible or deal they are offering is not good enough for you, what about trying to share
            your cards? Others can share a card with you and in return you can give them a card and share a card they
            might need in future.
            Finally there is always an option of borrowing a card from others even if this is only a temporary solution
            in exchange of a payment in form of card(s).
            All those examples are meant to show that this game encourages you to think creatively and negotiatie with
            others, there is no limit to what kind of deals you can make to help each other out.
            How to increase chances of winning?</p>
        <li>Trade</li>
        <p>Most likely you won't get great cards so it's worth to trade with others. The important thing is to
        always know what do you need, what others need and is there a way to create a deal that satisfy both of your
        needs.</p>
        
        <li>Borrow/share</li>
        <p>
            You're not limited to trading. Maybe borrowing, lending, sharing or a mix of it will work? Try to talk to
            others, emphasize what they will gain.
        </p>
        <li>Try to be lean</li>
        <p>
            Most cards you receive can be somewhat useful even though it might not appear so. For example having a
            second
            building of the same type might be beneficial so that you don't have to clean the first one when making the
            same
            agriculatural actions again. If card is of no use to you it might be a good idea to get rid of it by trading
            it
            to others in exchange of a card you need. The more you optimize your deck the more production you can
            accomplish
            throughout the game.
        </p>

        <li>Be assertive and creative</li>
        <p>It's good to be assertive, that is never accept a deal that you feel might not be good for you. Helping
            others
            is good as long as it helps your situation too. If unsure, you can always wait few turn and see what
            happens.
        </p>

        <li>And finally - be nice to each other</li>
        <p>
            It might sound weird by long-term it increases your chances of winning. The most likely scneario is that you
            might play more than one session with same players. By being too aggressive you risk being alienated in a
            difficult situation in the next session. So engaging with mutually beneficial trades help others to keep the
            trading door open and ultimately makes the game more fun and creative.</p>
